### Keyboard

The Keyboard menu relies on `localectl` to build up the list of available
Keyboard layouts and `setxkbmap` to set your preferred keyboard layout

If you have custom keyboard layouts mapped to `setxkbmap` you can map it
by adding a file called `keyboard.json` under `./custom` directory

It will look up for keys and an array of variants like the example below:

```[json]
{
  "rabay" : [
    "mac",
    "basic"
  ]
}
```
